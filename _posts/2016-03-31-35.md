This week Richard talks to Jade from Clarifai about her experience at Hacker School. She tells us to get our hands dirty in code as we follow her from freelancing on WordPress themes to Hacker School to her latest gig at Clarifai.

We've also got some great hardware hacks for you: <a href="http://devpost.com/software/quikcaption"> QuikCaption</a> and <a href="http://devpost.com/software/secret-set">SecretSet</a>.
