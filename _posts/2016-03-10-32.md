This week, Venmo Engineer &amp; Flatiron School grad Sarah Ransohoff talks about getting interested in tech, going to a bootcamp, getting the most of the experience, conquering frustration, focusing on learning, getting a gig, and more!

And as always, we've got two great staff picks for you:

With <a href="http://devpost.com/software/dreamote">Dreamote</a> you can draw virtual buttons and use them to control a real Arduino with OpenCV.

<a href="http://devpost.com/software/netra">Netra</a> uses your phone and Clarifai to describe the world around you in real-time.
