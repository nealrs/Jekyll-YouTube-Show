This week, we’re focusing on everybody’s least favorite part of job hunting: COVER LETTERS! Brandon, our CEO, joins us to talk about why you need to them, what you should include, what will set yours apart, and what <em>not</em> to do.

We’ve also got two great staff picks from <a href="http://spartahack2016.devpost.com">SpartaHack</a>: <a href="http://devpost.com/software/learninglock">LearningLock</a>, a neural network security layer for your Android and <a href="http://devpost.com/software/wake-9eqwob">Wake</a>, an alarm clock you can’t ignore.
