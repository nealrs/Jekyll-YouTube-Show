<p>Neal wanted to call this week’s episode, <em>Rumble in the RegEx,</em> but Richard was like “No, we’re gonna talk about text editors.” So yeah, we did a podcast about why we love Vim, Pico, Atom, and Sublime. But not Emacs.</p>

<p>Special guest appearances from Devpost engineer and Ronan Potage and Greenhouse engineer (and Devpost alum!) Juan Müller.</p>

<p>And of course, we’ve got the greatest staff picks OF ALL TIME: <a href="http://devpost.com/software/kanye-rest">Kanye Rest</a> and <a href="http://devpost.com/software/ramsay">Ramsay</a></p>
